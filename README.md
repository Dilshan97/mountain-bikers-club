# Mountain Bikers Club
## Technologies
- The application runs with Django, Celery, PostgreSQL and Redis.
- The maps are build with Leaflet and OpenStreetMap.
- The graphs are build thanks to Bokeh.
- The JavaScript and CSS are built on top of [my frontend library](https://github.com/cedeber/eukolia).

## Browsers support
Mountain Bikers Club doesn't support legacy browsers.

These are the minimun requirements (JavaScript is not mandatory):
- CSS variables
- CSS Grid
- ES 2017 support at minimun, as the app is loaded as an ES Module,
  which includes all API released before ES 2017.
- Web Component and Shadow DOM

## Hosting
- The website and the databases are hosted on Heroku.
- The user's files are uploaded and served via DigitalOcean Spaces.
- The DNS and the SSL certificate are managed through Cloudflare.
- The map tiles come from Komoot, OpenTopoMap and OpenCycleMap.

## Privacy
When I started to code websites in '98, we were used to listen to people's feedbacks.
This is the web I love. I am not going to install any script that do neither
statistics nor ads. As you may have noticed there is no Cookie banner.
It's not a mistake!
